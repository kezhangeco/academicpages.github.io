I am a PhD student in Cognitive Psychology at The University of British Columbia. I work with Dr. Luke Clark at [Centre for Gambling Research at UBC](https://cgr.psych.ubc.ca/). 

My research focuses on understanding the cognitive mechanisms of gambling behaviour using the framework of Behavioural Economics. I study how gamblers evaluate winning and losing outcomes and their subsequent betting decisions using loss aversion, reference point adaptation, mental accounting, cognitive biases and distortions. I also explore the application of Behavioural Economics in the cognitive behavioural intervention of gambling disorder, particularly in the behavioural expression of gambling problems - loss chasing.

My work use two methods:

1. **Laboratory experiments**
   - Recruiting gamblers for in-person and online experiments.

2. **Field observational data**
   - Analysing field gambling data obtained from the [PlayNow eCasino](https://www.playnow.com/casino/?utm_campaign=persistent-sem-casino-ecasino-bc-acquisition&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&gclid=Cj0KCQiAxoiQBhCRARIsAPsvo-zxCpplExBviSGeq0sku35anUOtKIaICwYZDapXZKsAtkwfolhNPEoaAu3eEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds).
