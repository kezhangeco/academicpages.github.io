# Introduction to Project Management

A standard operating procedure (SOP) of project management is important in improving research reproducibility and collaboration, but researchers new to computing may not know where to start. This workshop will help you to structure a practical workflow in six steps: 1) data management, 2) programming, 3) collaboration, 4) project organization, 5) version control, 6) manuscript. To improve the workflowâ€™s accessibility, this procedure will only require a minimum number of computing tools, including R/RStudio, Git/Github, Google Docs.
